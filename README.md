# U-TextEditor

## Description

This Progressive Web Application (PWA) is a feature-rich browser-based text editor that offers offline functionality, data persistence through IndexedDB, and seamless installation as a desktop app. Users can create and store notes or code snippets with or without an internet connection, ensuring reliable access to their content.

## Installation

- In the terminal, you have to first type the command 'npm install'. This command will read all the dependencies listed in the 'package.json' file and install them in a 'node_modules' folder. Then typing the command 'npm run start' starts the application in development mode and allows it to run on a local server. These instructions will be beneficial to a user who clones this code and wants to test that it works locally.
- When the browser loads and is opened, there should be a button, once clicked, that will allow you to download the PWA. Once downloaded, this PWA can be accessed with offline capabilities.
- This PWA is deployed on Render, the link will be available below.
